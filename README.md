Work repo for the Intentionally Blank WordPress theme

No update broke this, I had made change to index.php so that I could have a blank slate theme for building a PWA onto.

I had removed all outputs from index.php and placed the_content(); inside so that I could output a pages content only.
This way I can use the pages to create application pages with whatever I want on them.

I add functionality via a plugin and any styling is all self contained in the one plugin no interference from default theme.
